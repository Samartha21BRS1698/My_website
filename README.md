# Samartha — Portfolio Website

This is a simple, **editable** single-page portfolio website generated from the resume you provided. The content is prefilled from your resume. For reference, the resume used is attached to the project. See file reference in the conversation: fileciteturn0file0

## Files
- `index.html` — main site (editable in-browser)
- `styles.css` — styles
- `script.js` — small script to enable edit/save via localStorage
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use locally
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Click **Edit** to make changes inline. Click **Save** to store changes locally in your browser (localStorage).

## How to deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a GitHub repository (public).
2. Upload these files or push them using Git.
3. In repo settings → Pages, set branch to `main` and folder `/ (root)` and save.
4. Your site will be available at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/` within a minute or two.

## Notes
- The in-browser Save stores changes only on the current browser/device (localStorage). To make permanent edits, edit the files locally and push to GitHub.
- The project was created automatically. If you want me to prepare a ready-to-push Git commit or help deploy, reply and I will provide next steps.
